# A note on time

**NOTE**: Whenever Date-Time appears within this documentation, it is referring explicitly to the `date-time` primitive defined in [RFC339](https://xml2rfc.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14):

`1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00` would be a valid value for a Date-Time string, representing 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC (Pacific Standard Time). This is equivalent to 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z in UTC.
